; Exercise 3.31: The internal procedure accept-action-procedure!
; defined in make-wire specifies that when a new action procedure is added to a
; wire, the procedure is immediately run. Explain why this initialization is
; neccesary. In particular, trace through the half-adder example in the 
; paragrpahs above and say how the system's reponse would differ if we had
; defined accept-action-procedure! as

(define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
  (set! action-procedures
    (cons proc action-procedures)))

; First lets define make-wire as it is in the text.

(define (make-wire)
  (let ((signal-value 0) (action-procedures '()))
    (define (set-my-signal! new-value)
      (if (not (= signal-value new-value))
          (begin (set! signal-value new-value)
                 (call-each action-procedures))
          'done))
    (define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
      (set! action-procedures
            (cons proc action-procedures))
      (proc))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'get-signal) signal-value)
            ((eq? m 'set-signal!) set-my-signal!)
            ((eq? m 'add-action!) accept-action-procedure!)
            (else (error "Unknown operation: WIRE" m))))
    dispatch))

; We need each of the following defined as well:
(define (call-each procedures)
  (if (null? procedures)
      'done
      (begin ((car procedures))
             (call-each (cdr procedures)))))

(define (get-signal wire) (wire 'get-signal))

(define (set-signal! wire new-value)
  ((wire 'set-signal!) new-value))

(define (add-action! wire action-procedure)
  ((wire 'add-action!) action-procedure))

; The difference between the two accept-action-procedure! procedures is whether
; or not that procedure is immediately run when accepted. Let's see the 
; difference in the half-adder example

(define (after-delay delay action)
  (add-to-agenda! (+ delay (current-time the-agenda))
                  action
                  the-agenda))

(define (propagate)
  (if (empty-agenda? the-agenda)
      'done
      (let ((first-item (first-agenda-item the-agenda)))
        (first-item)
        (remove-first-agenda-item! the-agenda)
        (propagate))))

(define (inverter input output)
  (define (invert-input)

      (after-delay inverter-delay

  (define (and-action-procedure)

        (lambda () (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! o1 or-action-procedure)

(define (half-adder a b s c)
  (let ((d (make-wire)) (e (make-wire)))
    (or-gate a b d)
    (and-gate a b c)
    (inverter c e)

(define (probe name wire)
  (add-action! wire
               (lambda ()
                 (newline)
                 (display name) (display " ")

; make the simulation

(define the-agenda (make-agenda))
(define inverter-delay 2)
(define and-gate-delay 3)
(define or-gate-delay 5)

(define input-1 (make-wire))
(define input-2 (make-wire))
(define sum (make-wire))
(define carry (make-wire))

(probe 'sum sum)
(probe 'carry carry)

(half-adder input-1 input-2 sum carry)
(set-signal! input-1 1)
(propagate)

; simulation starts with propagate.
; propagate works on items in the agenda
; items in the agenda are added by add-to-agenda! which is only called by
; after-delay. after-delay is only called by the action procedures when they are
; so without running them when added there will be nothing in the agenda to
; call.
